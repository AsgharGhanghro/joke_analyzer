## 🌟 Overview

This project combines **NLP with a lightweight web app** to generate jokes on demand. The machine learning model is developed and trained in a Jupyter Notebook using a jokes dataset (CSV), and the results are served through a Python backend to a fun, responsive frontend.

Perfect for learning how to connect an NLP pipeline to a real web application!

---

## ✨ Features

- 🤖 **NLP-Based Generation** — Processes and serves jokes using trained patterns from the dataset
- 🌐 **Web Interface** — Clean, responsive frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- ⚡ **Fast Backend** — Python server (`start_app.py`) handles requests efficiently
- 📓 **Jupyter Notebook** — Full ML development and experimentation in `NLP.ipynb`
- 📊 **Rich Dataset** — Trained on 1000+ jokes across multiple categories
- 🚀 **Vercel Deployment** — One-click deployable to the web

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python **3.8 or higher**
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git
- A modern web browser

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asgharghanghro/Joke.git
cd Joke
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas numpy jupyter matplotlib scikit-learn flask
```

### 4. Start the Application

```bash
python start_app.py
```

Or use the launcher:

```bash
python launch.py
```

Then open your browser at **http://localhost:5000**

### 5. (Optional) Explore the Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook notebook/NLP.ipynb
```

## 🧠 How It Works

```
jokes.csv (Dataset)
      │
      ▼
NLP.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook)
  - Load & clean the dataset
  - Tokenize joke text
  - Extract patterns & features
  - Train the NLP model
      │
      ▼
start_app.py (Python Backend)
  - Loads the trained model
  - Handles API requests from frontend
      │
      ▼
client/ (Web Frontend)
  - User clicks "Generate Joke"
  - JavaScript calls the backend
  - Joke is displayed on screen
```

### NLP Pipeline Steps

1. **Data Loading** — Read `jokes.csv` with pandas
2. **Text Cleaning** — Remove special characters, normalize text
3. **Tokenization** — Split jokes into tokens/words
4. **Feature Extraction** — Convert text to numerical vectors
5. **Model Training** — Learn patterns from the joke dataset
6. **Joke Generation** — Retrieve or generate jokes based on learned patterns

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset lives in `data/jokes.csv` and contains:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `text` | The joke content |
| `category` | Type of joke (pun, dad joke, general, etc.) |
| `rating` | Quality score |

Sample examples are available in `notebook/dataset_examples.json` for quick reference without loading the full CSV.

---

## 🌐 Deployment

This project is deployed on **Vercel** using the `vercel.json` config file.

### Deploy Your Own Copy

1. Fork this repository
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → **New Project**
3. Import your forked GitHub repo
4. Vercel auto-detects the config and deploys
5. Your app is live! 🎉

### Manual Deploy via CLI

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
vercel --prod
```
